# Deep-Learning-Chicken-Detection
An ML.NET machine learning model for detecting chickens with a high succes rate


## Required: 
- Visual Studio 2019
- ML.Net NuGet Package
- Lots of Patience


## Instructions: 
Using the ML.Net model builder, you can make something similar to this, without downloading my code yourself. 
simply create a new c# console app and make sure you have the ML.Net package installed. Then, right click on the console app project in the solution viewer
and select Add > Machine learning. 

### Some good tutorials/resources:

Then follow the steps and BAM... You have a Deep learning model. 

If you would instead rather download my model, you will have to go through the releases tab, because some of the files are very large. Once you have installed it,
you will need to swap all of my file info with your own. This info can be found in each .cs file in the solution. Then Run "ChickenDetectionML.ConsoleApp"
